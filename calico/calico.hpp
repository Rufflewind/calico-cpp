Introduction
============

The majority of this library is header-only, so for those one can simply
install them (all contained in the `./calico` subdirectory) at an appropriate
place and include the headers in the code.

The only exception is the [Windows entry point module](@ref winentry.h), which
must be compiled and linked with the rest of the program.

Start by examining the various [modules](modules.html) and
[headers](files.html).
